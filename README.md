A simple and efficient Next Word Prediction model using N-gram language modeling techniques, implemented in Python. 
This project demonstrates how predictive text engines (like those in keyboards or search engines) can suggest the next most probable word given a context.

**Features**
- Trains a next word prediction model using unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.

- Uses N-gram frequency analysis for next-word suggestion.

- Cleans and tokenizes input text for effective training and prediction.

- Implements a basic interactive interface to input phrases and get predictions.
  
**Technologies Used**
- Python

- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

- Pandas & NumPy

- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

- Jupyter Notebook
